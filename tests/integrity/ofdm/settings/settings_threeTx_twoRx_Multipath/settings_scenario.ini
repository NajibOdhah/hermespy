# This file specifies the simulator scenario, i.e., the transmitter, receivers and channel models between them.
# The simulation may consist of several transmit and receive modems.
# All transmitters must be specified in sections 'TxModem_i', with i the transmit modem index, starting with i=1.
# All receivers must be specified in sections 'RxModem_j', with i the receive modem index, starting with j=1.
# Between every pair of receiver and transmitter modem, a channel model must be specified, in 'Channel_i_to_j'.
